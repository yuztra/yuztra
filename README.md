### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<img src="./yuztra-wordmark.png" alt="yuzu" width="300">
I'm Tjari (aka. yuztra), a guy who likes to do """illegal""" stuff and is (not) dedicated to archiving yuzu and Citra here.

I am previously known on GitHub as tjari1, but that account has since been flagged by GitHub.

**I am NOT affiliated with the Citra dev team** (who also develops yuzu).
